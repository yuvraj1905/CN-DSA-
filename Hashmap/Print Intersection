You have been given two integer arrays/lists (ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
void printIntersection(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {
 unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    if (n > m)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            mp[arr2[i]]++;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (mp.count(arr1[i]) == 1 && mp[arr1[i]] > 0)
            {
                cout << arr1[i] << endl;
                mp[arr1[i]]--;
            }
        }
    }
    else
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            mp[arr1[i]]++;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        {
            if (mp.count(arr2[i]) == 1 && mp[arr2[i]] > 0)
            {
                cout << arr2[i] << endl;
                mp[arr2[i]]--;
            }
        }
    }}
